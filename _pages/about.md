Welcome! I‚Äôm **Shixun Huang**, a fourth-year undergraduate student at the **University of Toronto**, majoring in **Mathematics** and **Computer Science** with a minor in **Statistics**.  
My academic and research interests span **machine learning**, **numerical methods**, **optimization**, and **physics-based simulation**.

Currently, I‚Äôm conducting research with **Professor Eitan Grinspun** at the **Dynamic Graphics Project Lab**, focusing on **neural methods for model order reduction** in real-time deformable object simulation. I also work on combining AI with traditional mathematical models, with applications in epidemiology and quantitative finance.

## Selected Projects
- **Latent-Space Optimization for Reduced-Order Simulation**  
  Developed an Input Convex Neural Network approach to improve generalization and stability in reduced-space simulations.
- **Hybrid SEIR Models with AI Integration**  
  Combined traditional compartmental models with machine learning for improved infectious disease forecasting.
- **High-Frequency Trading Decision Models**  
  Applied LightGBM to limit order book data for buy/sell/hold classification.
