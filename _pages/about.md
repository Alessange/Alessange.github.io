Hi! I'm <span style="color:#7A85C1;">*Shixun Huang*</span>, but you can also call me <span style="color:#7A85C1;">*Towa*</span>.  

I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at the <span style="color:#7A85C1; font-weight:bold;">*University of Toronto*</span>, majoring in <span style="color:#7A85C1; font-weight:bold;">*Mathematics*</span> and <span style="color:#7A85C1; font-weight:bold;">*Computer Science*</span>, with a minor in <span style="color:#7A85C1; font-weight:bold;">*Statistics*</span>.

Currently, I'm conducting research with <span style="color:#725CAD;">*[Professor Eitan Grinspun](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~eitan/)*</span> at the <span style="color:#725CAD;">[Dynamic Graphics Project Lab](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/)</span>, focusing on *neural methods for model order reduction* in real-time deformable object simulation. I am also working with <span style="color:#725CAD;">*[Professor Jude Dzevela Kong](https://www.mathematics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/jude-kong)*</span> at <span style="color:#725CAD;">[AIMMLab](https://aimmlab.org/)</span> on *mathematical modeling*.

## Research Interests
My research interests span <span style="color:#7A85C1; font-weight:bold;">*computer graphics*</span>, <span style="color:#7A85C1; font-weight:bold;">*machine learning*</span>, <span style="color:#7A85C1; font-weight:bold;">*mathematical modeling*</span>, and <span style="color:#7A85C1; font-weight:bold;">*optimization*</span>. I am particularly interested in using mathematical foundations to enhance current deep learning models, focusing on improving their efficiency and generalization capabilities for simulation, modeling, and data-driven scientific computing applications.
