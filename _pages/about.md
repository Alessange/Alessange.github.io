Hi! I'm <span style="color:#34699A; font-weight:bold;">*Shixun Huang*</span>, but you can also call me <span style="color:#34699A; font-weight:bold;">*Towa*</span>.  
I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at the **University of Toronto**, majoring in **Mathematics** and **Computer Science**, with a minor in **Statistics**.

Currently, I’m conducting research with <span style="color:#0046FF; font-weight:bold;">[Professor Eitan Grinspun](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~eitan/)</span> at the <span style="color:#33a02c; font-weight:bold;">[Dynamic Graphics Project Lab](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/)</span>, focusing on **neural methods for model order reduction** in real-time deformable object simulation. I am also working with <span style="color:#0046FF; font-weight:bold;">[Professor Jude Dzevela Kong](https://www.mathematics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/jude-kong)</span> at <span style="color:#ff7f00; font-weight:bold;">[AIMMLab](https://aimmlab.org/)</span> on **mathematical modeling of infectious diseases** using **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** methods and **SEIR-type epidemic models**.

## Research Interests
My research interests span **computer graphics**, **machine learning**, **mathematical modeling**, and **optimization**. I am particularly interested in leveraging mathematical ideas to accelerate or improve the generalization ability of current deep learning models, especially in the context of simulation, modeling, and data-driven scientific computing.
